# Frequently Asked Questions

This page answers common questions about using the **Entropic Collatz Conjector** project.

## Why study Collatz sequences with entropy?

Using entropy measurements highlights how the distribution of even and odd steps evolves as we iterate. It provides an intuitive way to compare starting seeds and classify their behaviour.

## Are the interactive plots required?

No. The project saves both static PNG images and interactive HTML files. The HTML versions allow zooming and hovering over individual seeds but they are not needed to understand the overall trends.

## Can I extend the analysis?

Absolutely. The code is written in a modular fashion. Feel free to modify the configuration values or add your own plotting routines.
